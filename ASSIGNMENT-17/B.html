    <p>
      <h3 class="h3">GENERAL APPEARANCE</h3>
      <div class="div1">
        Bulldogs have characteristically wide heads and shoulders along with a pronounced mandibular prognathism. There are generally thick folds of skin on the brow; round, black, wide-set eyes; a short muzzle with characteristic folds called a rope or nose roll above the nose; hanging skin under the neck </div><br />
        <div class="div2">
          drooping lips and pointed teeth, and an underbite with an upturned jaw. The coat is short, flat, and sleek with colours of red, fawn, white, brindle, and piebald.
       
      </div><br />
      
      
      <div class="div3">
        Bulldogs are one of the few breeds whose tail is naturally short and either straight, screwed or thin and thus is not cut or docked as with some other breeds. A straight tail is a more desirable tail according to the breed standard set forth by the BCA if it is facing downward, not upwards
      </div>
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <h3 class="h31">Temperament</h3>
      <div class="div1">
        According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), a Bulldog's disposition should be "equable and kind, resolute, and courageous (not vicious or aggressive), and demeanor should be pacifist and dignified. These attributes should be countenanced by the expression and behavior".
      </div><br>
      
      <div class="div2">
        Breeders have worked to reduce/remove aggression from these dogs.[6] Most have a friendly, patient, but stubborn nature. Bulldogs are recognized as excellent family pets because of their tendency to form strong bonds with children
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div3">
        Generally, Bulldogs are known for getting along well with children, other dogs, and other pets.

      <h3 class="h3">HEALTH</h3>
      <div class="div1">
        A 2004 UK survey of 180 Bulldog deaths puts the median age at death at 6 years 3 months. The leading cause of death of Bulldogs in the survey was cardiac related (20%), cancer (18%), and old age (9%). Those that died of old age had an average lifespan of 10 to 11 years.[2] A 2013 UK vet clinic survey of 26 Bulldogs puts the median lifespan at 8.4 years with an interquartile range of 3.2–11.3 years.[3] The UK Bulldog Breed Council website lists the average life span of the breed as 8–10 years.
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div2">
        Statistics from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals indicate that of the 467 Bulldogs tested between 1979 and 2009 (30 years), 73.9% were affected by hip dysplasia, the highest amongst all breeds.[20] Similarly, the breed has the worst score in the British Veterinary Association/Kennel Club Hip Dysplasia scoring scheme, although only 22 Bulldogs were tested in the scheme.[21] Patellar luxation affects 6.2% of Bulldogs.[
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div3">
        Over 80% of Bulldog litters are delivered by Caesarean section[23] because their characteristically large heads can become lodged in the mother's birth canal. The folds, or "rope", on a Bulldog's face should be cleaned daily to avoid infections caused by moisture accumulation. Some Bulldogs' naturally curling tails can be so tight to the body as to require regular cleaning and ointment. Due to the high volume of skin folds on the Bulldog's body, they have high prevalence of skin-fold dermatitis
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div4">
        Like all dogs, Bulldogs require daily exercise. If not properly exercised it is possible for a Bulldog to become overweight, which could lead to heart and lung problems, as well as stress on the joints.[

      <h3 class="h31">AS A MASCOT</h3>
      <div class="div1">
        The Bulldog is popularly used to represent England or the United Kingdom.[8] It has been associated with Winston Churchill's defiance of Nazi Germany.
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div2">
        The Bulldog's reputation for being pugnacious and combative saw the 19th century scientist Thomas Henry Huxley given the nickname "Darwin's Bulldog" for his role as an outspoken defender and advocate for Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div3">
        Thirty-nine American universities use a Bulldog as their mascot including Georgetown, Butler, CSU Fresno State,[33] Drake,[34] Gonzaga,[35] North Carolina A&T, Mississippi State,[36] Louisiana Tech, Yale,[37] The Citadel[38] South Carolina State,[39] Georgia,[40] University of Redlands,[41] and the University of Minnesota Duluth.

        The Bulldog is an official mascot of the Croatian ultras group Bad Blue Boys, which supports the football club GNK Dinamo Zagreb.[citation needed]

The Australian Rugby League team Canterbury–Bankstown has a Bulldog as its emblem and mascot.[citation needed]

    <h2 id="dog2">Pomeranian</h2>
    <p>
      <h3 class="h3">APPEARANCE</h3>
      <div class="div1">
        Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm) high at the withers.[3] They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.[4] The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters.[5]
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div2">
        Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend that it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year.[9]
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div3">
        The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the end of the 19th century.[6] In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors of any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and tan, brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti, plus combinations of those colors.[7] The most common colors are orange, black, or cream/white.[4]
      </div><br />
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <h3 class="h31">BEHAVIOUR</h3>
      
      <div class="div1">
        Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful. They can be aggressive with other dogs and humans to try to prove themselves
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div2">
        Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div3">
        Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners.[13] They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, but they can become dominant, willful and stubborn if not well trained and socialized.[13] The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.
      </div>
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <h3 id="h3">HEALTH</h3>
      
      <div class="div1">
        The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years.[14][better source needed] A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog.[
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div2">
        The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build.
      </div><br />
      
      <div class="div3">
        Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided.[17] They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended.[18] Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.[19
      </div>

      <h3 class="h31">ORIGANS</h3>
      <div class="div1">
        The forerunners of today's Pomeranian breed were large working dogs from the Arctic regions. These dogs are commonly known as the Wolfspitz or Spitz type, which is German for "sharp point" which was the term originally used by Count Eberhard zu Sayn in the 16th century as a reference to the features of the dog's nose and muzzle. The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz.[26]
      </div><br />
      
      <div id="div2">
        The breed is thought to have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.[26]
      </div><br>
      
      <div class="div3">
        Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a large breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian which she possibly named "Windsor's Marco" and was reported to weigh only 12 lb (5.4 kg). When she first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller-type Pomeranian to become immediately popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%.[26] Queen Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians[29] of different colours from various European countries to add to her breeding program.[30] Royal owners during this period also included Joséphine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of France, and King George IV of England.
